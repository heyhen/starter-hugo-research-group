Our **Research Group** aims to use information from the genome to optimize clinical care and therapeutic benefit for individuals suffering from disease.

Here, we focuse on epilepsy and other ion channel related diseases.

Our computational research lab is located at the Hasso Plattner Institute (University of Potsdam, Germany).
