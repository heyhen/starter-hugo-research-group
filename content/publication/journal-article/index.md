summary: Epilepsy is a frequent feature of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs),
  but little is known about genetic differences between NDDs with and without
  epilepsy. We analyzed de novo variants (DNVs) in 6,753 parentâ€“offspring trios
  ascertained to have different NDDs. In the subset of 1,942 individuals with
  NDDs with epilepsy, we identified 33 genes with a significant excess of DNVs,
  of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence of disease
  association. Joint analysis of all individuals with NDDs also implicated
  CACNA1E as a novel disease-associated gene. Comparing NDDs with and without
  epilepsy, we found missense DNVs, DNVs in specific genes, age of recruitment,
  and severity of intellectual disability to be associated with epilepsy. We
  further demonstrate the extent to which our results affect current genetic
  testing as well as treatment, emphasizing the benefit of accurate genetic
  diagnosis in NDDs with epilepsy.
